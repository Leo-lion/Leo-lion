# 👋 Hi, I'm Avinash

I work mainly with **ColdFusion** and **PHP**, and I enjoy backend development in general.  
Most of my experience is with real, day-to-day projects where reliability matters more than fancy code.  
I like fixing things, improving slow queries, and keeping older systems running smoothly.

- ColdFusion / CFML  ? Coldbox
- PHP (Core, OOP)

## A bit more about me

I like understanding how systems actually work under the hood.  
Most of the projects I’ve worked on needed stability, long-term maintenance, and performance fixes.  
I enjoy code that’s readable and maintainable — it makes everyone’s life easier.
